# Statistical Analysis of COVID-19 in France

### Project Description
This project aims to **analyze the trends and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland France** using descriptive and inferential statistical methods.

The study covers **the years 2020 and 2021**, with a particular focus on **the first three epidemic waves**.  
The data was **imported from INSEE and Santé Publique France**, then stored in an **SQL** database before being analyzed with **R**.

This research was conducted in French, and all datasets, labels, and documents are in French.

### Data and Methodology

#### Data Sources
- **INSEE** → Demographic and socio-economic data.  
- **Santé Publique France** → Data on the evolution of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths related to COVID-19.  

#### Technologies Used
- **SQL** → Data storage and querying.  
- **R (ggplot2, dplyr, DBI, knitr)** → Cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  
- **R Markdown** → Generation of the report in HTML.

### Code, Data, and Analysis Report
The R code allows for manipulating SQL databases to import and process data, performing descriptive and inferential statistical analyses on pandemic trends, and visualizing data using static graphs. The data used is stored as .csv files in the data/ folder. This code is available in the covid19_analysis_code_R.Rmd file, and the HTML result generated from this code is available in the covid19_analysis_report.html file.
